# Backbone.Epoxy

Computed models and live data binding for Backbone.

Backbone.Epoxy brings live data binding and computed model properties to Backbone with a modest file weight (4.4kb, 1.6kb-gzipped), while simplifying binding procedures. Declarative bindings and automatic dependency mapping are heavily inspired by Knockout.js. The project is still new... more to come.

## Requirements

 - Backbone (>= 0.9.9)
 - Underscore  (>= 1.4.3)
