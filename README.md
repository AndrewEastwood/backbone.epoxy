# Backbone.Epoxy

Computed models and live data binding for Backbone.

Backbone.Epoxy brings live data binding and computed model properties to Backbone with a modest file weight (3kb, 1.5-gzipped), while simplifying binding procedures. Declarative bindings and automatic dependency mapping are heavily inspired by Knockout.js. The project is still new... updated to come.
