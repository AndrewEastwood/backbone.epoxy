Epoxy is an easy and extensible data binding library for Backbone,
providing model computations and declarative view binding for a modest
total file size (7kb minified, 3.5k gzipped). Epoxy borrows heavily
from some great parts of Knockout.js and Ember.js, and tries to
provide some of their power through a simple API that still feels
tastefully like Backbone. To that end, Epoxy provides extended
versions of Backbone's Model and View classes for you to build from.
Key features of each:

Epoxy.Model
 - observable and computed properties.
 - automatic dependency mapping.

Epoxy.View
 - declarative data bindings.
 - automatic view updates.
 - easily extensible binding handlers.

Customize it:

Data binding is very powerful, and quite slick when you can make it
work for your purposes. While Epoxy's default binding handlers only
offer the basics, the system is designed to make it --truly-- easy and
efficient to compose your own binding hooks. The API has been
specifically designed to be simple, and its features slightly limited,
both to make it easy for developers to innovate within the system, and
to stave off the temptation for messy binding declarations that are
too smart for their own good.

Use only what you need:

While Epoxy's model and view components are designed to enhance one
another's capabilities, they do not depend on one another to function.
Therefore, you're welcome to use just Epoxy models or views within
your project, omitting the other component entirely (each component
weighs in at about 3.5kb, 1.5kb gzipped). The two Epoxy components are
available separately so you can include only what your project needs.
